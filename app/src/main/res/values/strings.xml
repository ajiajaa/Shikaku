    <string name="tutor1">So, Shikaku is a board game that contains many cells with numbers in them.</string>
    <string name="tutor2">Like the example below!</string>
    <string name="tutor3">For this tutorial, let\'s use a 2x2 board.</string>
    <string name="tutor4">Your job is to divide the board into rectangles.</string>
    <string name="tutor5">Each rectangle contains only ONE number.</string>
    <string name="tutor6">The number indicates how many cells are contained in the rectangle.</string>

    <string name="tutor7">Try to create rectangles in this puzzle by swiping your finger and solve it.</string>
    <string name="tutor8">Nice! You\'ve got this!</string>

    <string name="rules1">"1. The divided square areas must contain a single number indicating the area of the square region.</string>
    <string name="rules3">3. No divided square area should overlap with another divided square area.</string>
